This repository demonstrates a common error in TypeScript: unhandled exceptions. The `bug.ts` file contains a function that performs basic arithmetic operations but lacks proper error handling.  The `bugSolution.ts` file shows how to improve the code by adding try-catch blocks to handle potential errors gracefully. This example highlights the importance of robust error handling for building reliable applications.
